    /* represent the pieces from tetris, with 4 lines of 4 columns.
    They are positionned to be at the bottom and the left of the table.
    
    Exemple :
    The first one {0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1} represent the horizontal line :
    0 0 0 0
    0 0 0 0
    0 0 0 0
    1 1 1 1

    note : the order of the piece is the same that the one of wikipedia's table (https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/tetris#Pi√®ces_du_jeu)

    The tables are declared again (even if there is alredy tables in parameters) to don't have to fill them cell by cell, like this :
    tab1[0] = a;
    tab1[1] = b
    ...
    tab10[5] = zza...
